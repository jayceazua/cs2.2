## Challenge 1
- Implement the Graph ADT with an adjacency list
- Implement code to read in a graph from a text file to create an instance of the Graph ADT and use its methods.

**Input:** A graph file (can contain a directed or undirected graph with or without weights)
`python3 challenge_1.py graph_data.txt`
```
G
1,2,3,4
(1,2,10)
(1,4,5)
(2,3,5)
(2,4,7)
```

**Output:**
* The # vertices in the graph.
* The # edges in the graph.
* A list of the edges with their weights (if weighted)

```
# Vertices: 4
# Edges: 4
Edge List:
(1,2,10)
(1,4,5)
(2,3,5)
(2,4,7)

```



### Stretch Challenge 1
- Re-implement the Graph ADT using one of the [python collections](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/collections.html#module-collections).
